# Queue_Division_Automation
A web application that automates the process of generating the queue division based on the schedules and number of the engineers
## Description
Our Support team operates on a shift basis, with the number of engineers working each day varying. The workday extends for 13 hours, and engineers have the option to choose their shift, whether it be in the morning, afternoon, or evening.

Previously, the division of the General Queue, which receives all customer tickets, among the engineers was done manually using an excel file. This process was time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this issue, I developed a web application that automates the process of generating the queue division based on the schedules  and number of the engineers. The application presents the queue division in a clear and organized manner, and also allows for easy adjustment if an engineer is unable to work. Additionally, the queue division can be easily sent to Slack with the press of a button, eliminating the need for any manual work.
